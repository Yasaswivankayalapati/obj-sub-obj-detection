# obj-sub-obj-detection
Pseudo-Code for Hierarchical Object and Sub-Object Detection
1. Initialize Environment
Import necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV).
Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
Define object-subobject relationships:
Example: "Person" → "Helmet", "Car" → "Tire".
2. Load Input Data
Input video stream or image frames.
Preprocess frames:
Resize images to the model's input size.
Normalize pixel values if required.
3. Object Detection
Pass each frame to the object detection model.
For each detected object:
Extract:
Class label (e.g., "Car", "Person").
Bounding box coordinates.
Confidence scores (filter low-confidence detections).
4. Sub-Object Detection
For each detected object:
Crop the region within the bounding box.
Run the sub-object detection model on the cropped region.
Extract:
Sub-object labels (e.g., "Tire", "Helmet").
Sub-object bounding box (relative to the crop).
5. Hierarchical Association
Assign a unique ID to each object and sub-object.
Create a hierarchical JSON structure for detected objects:
json

{
  "object": "Car",
  "id": 1,
  "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
  "subobject": {
    "object": "Tire",
    "id": 1,
    "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]
  }
}
6. Save Sub-Object Crops
Crop and save sub-object regions as images:
File naming: <Object><SubObject><ID>.jpg.
7. Real-Time Optimization
Track processing time per frame using a timer.
Optimize for real-time processing:
Use multi-threading for frame preprocessing.
Convert models to lightweight versions (e.g., TensorRT, ONNX).
8. Benchmark and Extend
Test the system with sample inputs to benchmark performance (FPS, accuracy).
Ensure the code is modular to allow adding new object-subobject pairs.
